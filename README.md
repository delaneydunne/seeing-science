Seeing science (SS) is a platform that serves to increase the accessibility of science through <b>visual representations</b>. Although people may come from many different backgrounds, SS provides a database of scientific animations to assist education.
			
The operation is <b>community-driven</b>. That is, by following our contribution guidelines, anyone from enthusiastic students to retired professors can generate animations! In fact, it is encouraged that users also submit the code they used to generate these animations.

To ensure proper outreach of the platform, SS utilizes a <b>level system</b>. Based off your previous scientific experience, animations and explanations are set to your level of background to maximize your understanding.

By following these norms, Seeing Science strives to promote community collaboration and education in a style that is accessible to all and permanently available.
