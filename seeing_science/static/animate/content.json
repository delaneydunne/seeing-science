		"text_before": "The first task is to generate a set of data for the function to animate. Let's say we want to illustrate the expansion of a circle. Then, for each frame of the animation, we need a new circle object whose radius reflects how long it has been since the start of the animation.",
		"code": "circle_angles = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi) \nx_pos = np.cos(circle_angles) \ny_pos = np.sin(circle_angles) \nunit_circle = np.hstack((x_pos[:,None], y_pos[:,None]))",

		"text_before": "To make our circle expand, we need to resize the unit circle as a function of the frame number.",

		"text_after": "The final command keeps track of the line object that we have plotted. Because of this, we will be able to access the x and y values of the line to edit the location of the circle at every frame."
